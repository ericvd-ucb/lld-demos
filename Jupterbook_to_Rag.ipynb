paradigm of the prisoner's dilemma, and oligopolies. These concepts are essential to understanding the models we will be studying the next sections, and for relating game theory to its economic applications.\n## Equilibrium\n\nThe [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is a classic game first discussed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950. In this game, there are two prisoners who have been captured and are being interrogated. The prisoners cannot contact each other in any way. They have two options: they can **defect** (betray the other prisoner to the police) or they can **cooperate** (maintain their silence). If both defect, both receive 4 years in prison. If one defects and the other does not, the defector goes free and the cooperator receives 5 years in prison. If both cooperate (meaning neither talks to the police), then they each receive 2 years in prison. We define **mutual defection** as the case when both prisoners defect and **mutual cooperation** as the case when both cooperate. The purpose of this game is to consider how a completely rational person would be best advised to proceed, and how different strategies for playing this game can be more or less effective.\n\n<table class=\"payoff-matrix\" style=\"text-align: center; table-layout: fixed;\">\n    \n<tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"170\" style=\"border-width: 0 1px 1px 0;\"></td>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Prisoner B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td width=\"85\">Cooperate</td>\n    <td width=\"85\">Defect</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Prisoner A</td>\n    <td>Cooperate</td>\n    <td>(2, 2)</td>\n    <td>(5, 0)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>Defect</td>\n    <td>(0, 5)</td>\n    <td>(4, 4)</td>\n</tr>\n    \n</table>\n\nIn the above payoff matrix, we see that if Prisoner A cooperates and Prisoner B defects, then Prisoner A gets 5 years in prisoner and Prisoner B gets none. It is important to note that the above payoff matrix is inverted; because we are talking about _years in prison_ as opposed to utility, a higher value is **worse** for the player, and a player's goal is to _minimize_ their value in the payoff matrix, not maximize it as normally. We will use this payoff matrix convention when discussing the prisoner's dilemma, but _not_ with other games.\n\nAn important concept in game theory is finding the equilibrium of a game. There are different types of equilibria, but the most common one considered is the **Nash equilibrium**, named for the mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr. (who you may remember as a character played by Russel Crowe in [_A Beautiful Mind_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film))). A Nash equilibrium occurs when no player can increase their own payoff by changing only their own strategy.\n```{admonition} Definition\nA **Nash equilibrium** is a set of strategy choices in a non-cooperative game in which each player, assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, has a chosen strategy and there can be no monotonic improvement; that is, no player can increase their payoffs by changing their strategy without another player changing _their_ strategy.\n```\nUsing this definition, what constitutes a Nash equilibrium for the prisoner's dilemma? Well let's consider the four possible combinations of strategies. (We use \"D\" as shorthand for \"defect\" and \"C\" for \"cooperate\" below.)\n\n1. **Prisoner A: C, Prisoner B: C.** In this case, both Prisoner A and Prisoner B get 4 years. However, if Prisoner A's strategy remains unchanged, Prisoner B can get fewer years in prison by changing to D, and vice versa. Thus, this is **not** a Nash equilibrium.\n2. **Prisoner A: D, Prisoner B: C.** In this case, Prisoner B can change to D and lower their years from 5 to 4. Thus, this is **not** a Nash equilibrium.\n3. **Prisoner A: C, Prisoner B: D.** As with (2), Prisoner A can change to D and lower their years in prison. Thus, this is **not** a Nash equilibrium.\n4. **Prisoner A: D, Prisoner B: D.** In this case, if Prisoner A changes to C, then their years in prison _increases_ from 4 to 5, as with Prisoner B. Neither player can increase their winnings (decrease their years in prison) by changing their strategy. Thus, this **is** a Nash equilibrium.\n\nBy describing the four states of the game, we see that only mutual defection is a Nash equilibrium of the prisoner's dilemma.\n```{admonition} Nash equilibria in payoff matrices\n:class: tip\n\nIt is easy to use a payoff matrix to  see which  states, if any, are Nash equilibria. To see if a game state is a Nash equilibrium, the first value in the cell must be the maximum among all first values in that column and the second value must be the maximum across all second values in that row. This is because moving up and down a column represents changing the row-player's strategy and  moving along a row represents changing the column-player's strategy. If these values are both maxima in their respective directions, then no player can obtain a better payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, and we have a Nash equilibrium.\n\nYou can easily verify this by looking at the payoff matrix for the prisoner's dilemma: the  first 4 in mutual defection has the best payoff in the column and the second  4 has the best payoff in the row.\n```\n## Oligopolies\n\nOne of the most common applications of game theory in economics is the study of **oligopolies**, markets where the number of participants is limited. There are several examples of oligopolies that we experience without knowing in daily life: airlines, soft drinks, and telecom providers, to name a few. Oligopolies are different from regular markets in that they allow their participants to function similar to a monopoly by setting prices as a group; groups of participants conspiring on this kind of illicit activity are referred to as **cartels**. \n\nWithin oligopolies, however, we can observe competition more like a normal market as firms attempt to take market share from one another. When cartels set prices (by limiting the production of the good or service provided by their market), a firm can make a bid for market share by ignoring the agreed-upon production level and producing more. This has the effect of lowering the price of the good but the increase in production by the renegade firm will allow them to make up for the lost marginal revenue through increased sales volume. In this way, oligopoly members can compete against each other, making the market more and more competitive.\n\nA prime example of this type of within-cartel competition was observed in the [2020 oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Russia%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_oil_price_war). Both countries are members of [OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC), an oil cartel that consists of 12 member countries controlling 79% of the world's oil reserves and 44% of oil production. OPEC sets oil prices by limiting the output of its member countries (a decrease in production results in higher prices).\n\nThe price war began when Saudi Arabia discounted its oil in response to Russia's refusal to reduce production in accordance with OPEC's directive. OPEC's members had agreed to reduce oil production due to a low forecasted demand for oil due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When Russia (who was not an official member of OPEC but had agreed to cooperate with Saudi Arabia to manage oil prices) didn't abide  by OPEC's decision, Saudi Arabia announced discounts on its oil, starting the price war and leading to a massive drop in the price of oil. We can see the effects of this price war by looking at the price per barrel of OPEC's crude oil, plotted below.\n```\nold plot code -- this cell is removed\nuso = Table.read_table(\"USO.csv\")\ndates = uso.apply(pd.to_datetime, \"Date\")\nuso = uso.with_column(\"Date\", dates)\nuso.to_df().plot.line(\"Date\", \"Close\", figsize=[15,7], legend=False)\nplt.vlines(dt.datetime(2020, 3, 8), -5, 125, color=\"r\")\nplt.ylim(0, 120)\nplt.xlim(min(uso.column(\"Date\")), max(uso.column(\"Date\")))\nplt.ylabel(\"USO Closing Price\");\n```\nThe plot above marks the official start of the price war on March 8, 2020, in red. We see some precipitous drops both just before and for a while after the start of the price war, indicating the effect that it is having on oil prices.

This is the point at which the demand and supply curves meet and represents the \"optimal\" level of production and price in that market.\n```{admonition} Definition\nThe **market equilibrium** is the price and quantity at which the demand and supply curves intersect. The price and resulting transaction quantity at the equilibrium is what we would predict to observe in the market.\n```\nLet's walk through how to the market equilibrium using the market for oranges as an example.\n### Data Preprocessing\n\nBecause we are only examining the relationship between prices and quantity for oranges, we can create a new table with the relevant columns: `Year`, `Orange Price`, and `Orange Unloads`. Here, `Orange Price` is measured in dollars, while `Orange Unloads` is measured in tons.\nNext, we will rename our columns. In this case, let's rename `Orange Unloads` to `Quantity` and `Orange Price` to `Price` for brevity and understandability. \n### Visualize the  Relationship\n\nLet's first take a look to see what the relationship between price and quantity is. We would expect to see a downward-sloping relationship between price and quantity; if a product's price increases, consumers will purchase less, and if a product's price decreases, then consumers will purchase more. \n\nWe will create a scatterplot between the points.\n\n[Following image is a scatter plot for demand for oranges]\nThe visualization shows a negative relationship between quantity and price, which is in line with our expectations: as the price increases, fewer consumers will purchase oranges, so the quantity demanded will decrease. This corresponds to a leftward movement along the demand curve. Alternatively, as the price decreases, the quantity sold will increase because consumers want to maximize their purchasing power and buy more oranges; this is shown by a rightward movement along the curve.\n### Fit a Polynomial\n\nWe will now quantify our demand curve using NumPy's [`np.polyfit` function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html). Recall that `np.polyfit` returns an array of size 2, where the first element is the slope and the second is the $y$-intercept.\n\nFor this exercise, we will be expressing demand and supply as quantities in terms of price. \nThis shows that the demand curve is $D(P) = -3433 P+ 53626$. The slope is -3433 and $y$-intercept is 53626. That means that as price increases by 1 unit (in this case, \\$1), quantity decreases by 3433 units (in this case, 3433 tons). \n\n### Create the Demand Curve\n\nWe will now use SymPy to write out this demand curve. To do so, we start by creating a symbol `P` that we can use to create the equation.\n### Create the Supply Curve\n\nAs you've learned, the supply curve is the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity of that good or service that the seller is willing to supply. It shows how much of a good suppliers are willing and able to supply at different prices. In this case, as the price of the oranges increases, the quantity of oranges that orange manufacturers are willing to supply increases. They capture the producer's side of market decisions and are upward-sloping.\n\nLet's now assume that the supply curve is given by $S(P) = 4348P$. (Note that this supply curve is not based on data.)\n This means that as the price of oranges increases by 1, the quantity supplied increases by 4348. At a price of 0, no oranges are supplied.\n### Find the Price Equilibrium\n\nWith the supply and demand curves known, we can solve the for equilibrium. \nThe equilibrium is the point where the supply curve and demand curve intersect, and denotes the price and quantity of the good transacted in the market.\n\nThe equilbrium consists of 2 components: the quantity equilbrium and price equilbrium. \nThe price equilibrium is the price at which the supply curve and demand curve intersect: the price of the good that consumers desire to purchase at is equivalent to the price of the good that producers want to sell at. There is no shortage of surplus of the product at this price.\n\n\nLet's find the price equilibrium. To do this, we will use the provided `solve` function. This is a custom function that leverages some SymPy magic and will be provided to you in assignments.\nThis means that the price of oranges that consumers want to purchase at and producers want to provide is about \\$6.89. \n### Find the Quantity Equilibrium\n\nSimilarly, the quantity equilibrium is the quantity of the good that consumers desire to purchase is equivalent to the quantity of the good that producers supply; there is no shortage or surplus of the good at this quantity. \n\n\nThis means that the number of tons of oranges that consumers want to purchase and producers want to provide in this market is about 29,967 tons of oranges. \n### Visualize the Market Equilibrium \n\nNow that we have our demand and supply curves and price and quantity equilibria, we can visualize them on a graph to see what they look like. \n\nThere are 2 pre-made functions we will use: `plot_equation` and `plot_intercept`.\n- `plot_equation`: It takes in the equation we made previously (either demand or supply) and visualizes the equations between the different prices we give it\n- `plot_intercept`: It takes in two different equations (demand and supply), finds the point at which the two intersect, and creates a scatter plot of the result\nWe can leverage these functions and the equations we made earlier to create a graph that shows the market equilibrium.\n\n[Following image is a scatter plot for supply and demand for oranges]\nYou can also practice on your own and download additional data sets [here](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/datasets.html), courtesy of the University of Flordia's Statistics Department. \n## Movements Away from Equilibrium\n\nWhat happens to market equilibrium when either supply or demand shifts due to an exogenous shock?\n\nLet's assume that consumers now prefer Green Tea as their hot beverage of choice moreso than before. We have an outward shift of the demand curve - quantity demanded is greater at every price. The market is no longer in equilibrium.\n\n[Following image is a hand drawn diagram of a shift in demand]\n```{figure} fig1-demand.png\n---\nwidth: 500px\nname: demand-shift\n---\nA shift in the demand curve\n```\n![title](fig1-demand.png)\nAt the same price level (the former equilibrium price), there is a shortage of Green Tea. The amount demanded by consumers exceeds that supplied by producers: $Q_D > Q_S$. This is a seller's market, as the excess quantity demanded gives producers leverage (or market power) over consumers. They are able to increase the price of Green Tea to clear the shortage. As prices increase, consumers who were willing and able to purchase tea at the previous equilibrium price would leave the market, reducing quantity demanded. $Q_S$ and $Q_D$ move up along their respective curves until the new equilibrium is achieved where $Q_S = Q_D$. \n\nThis dual effect of increasing $Q_S$ and $Q_D$ is sometimes referred to as the \"invisible hand\". Sans government intervention, it clears out the shortage or surplus in the market, resulting in the eventual convergence to a new equilibrium level of quantity $Q^*$ and price $P^*$.\n \n\nResult 2: # Market Equilibria\n\nWe will now explore the relationship between price and quantity of oranges produced between 1924 and 1938.

This is the point at which the demand and supply curves meet and represents the \"optimal\" level of production and price in that market.\n```{admonition} Definition\nThe **market equilibrium** is the price and quantity at which the demand and supply curves intersect. The price and resulting transaction quantity at the equilibrium is what we would predict to observe in the market.\n```\nLet's walk through how to the market equilibrium using the market for oranges as an example.\n### Data Preprocessing\n\nBecause we are only examining the relationship between prices and quantity for oranges, we can create a new table with the relevant columns: `Year`, `Orange Price`, and `Orange Unloads`. Here, `Orange Price` is measured in dollars, while `Orange Unloads` is measured in tons.\nNext, we will rename our columns. In this case, let's rename `Orange Unloads` to `Quantity` and `Orange Price` to `Price` for brevity and understandability. \n### Visualize the  Relationship\n\nLet's first take a look to see what the relationship between price and quantity is. We would expect to see a downward-sloping relationship between price and quantity; if a product's price increases, consumers will purchase less, and if a product's price decreases, then consumers will purchase more. \n\nWe will create a scatterplot between the points.\n\n[Following image is a scatter plot for demand for oranges]\nThe visualization shows a negative relationship between quantity and price, which is in line with our expectations: as the price increases, fewer consumers will purchase oranges, so the quantity demanded will decrease. This corresponds to a leftward movement along the demand curve. Alternatively, as the price decreases, the quantity sold will increase because consumers want to maximize their purchasing power and buy more oranges; this is shown by a rightward movement along the curve.\n### Fit a Polynomial\n\nWe will now quantify our demand curve using NumPy's [`np.polyfit` function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html). Recall that `np.polyfit` returns an array of size 2, where the first element is the slope and the second is the $y$-intercept.\n\nFor this exercise, we will be expressing demand and supply as quantities in terms of price. \nThis shows that the demand curve is $D(P) = -3433 P+ 53626$. The slope is -3433 and $y$-intercept is 53626. That means that as price increases by 1 unit (in this case, \\$1), quantity decreases by 3433 units (in this case, 3433 tons). \n\n### Create the Demand Curve\n\nWe will now use SymPy to write out this demand curve. To do so, we start by creating a symbol `P` that we can use to create the equation.\n### Create the Supply Curve\n\nAs you've learned, the supply curve is the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity of that good or service that the seller is willing to supply. It shows how much of a good suppliers are willing and able to supply at different prices. In this case, as the price of the oranges increases, the quantity of oranges that orange manufacturers are willing to supply increases. They capture the producer's side of market decisions and are upward-sloping.\n\nLet's now assume that the supply curve is given by $S(P) = 4348P$. (Note that this supply curve is not based on data.)\n This means that as the price of oranges increases by 1, the quantity supplied increases by 4348. At a price of 0, no oranges are supplied.\n### Find the Price Equilibrium\n\nWith the supply and demand curves known, we can solve the for equilibrium. \nThe equilibrium is the point where the supply curve and demand curve intersect, and denotes the price and quantity of the good transacted in the market.\n\nThe equilbrium consists of 2 components: the quantity equilbrium and price equilbrium. \nThe price equilibrium is the price at which the supply curve and demand curve intersect: the price of the good that consumers desire to purchase at is equivalent to the price of the good that producers want to sell at. There is no shortage of surplus of the product at this price.\n\n\nLet's find the price equilibrium. To do this, we will use the provided `solve` function. This is a custom function that leverages some SymPy magic and will be provided to you in assignments.\nThis means that the price of oranges that consumers want to purchase at and producers want to provide is about \\$6.89. \n### Find the Quantity Equilibrium\n\nSimilarly, the quantity equilibrium is the quantity of the good that consumers desire to purchase is equivalent to the quantity of the good that producers supply; there is no shortage or surplus of the good at this quantity. \n\n\nThis means that the number of tons of oranges that consumers want to purchase and producers want to provide in this market is about 29,967 tons of oranges. \n### Visualize the Market Equilibrium \n\nNow that we have our demand and supply curves and price and quantity equilibria, we can visualize them on a graph to see what they look like. \n\nThere are 2 pre-made functions we will use: `plot_equation` and `plot_intercept`.\n- `plot_equation`: It takes in the equation we made previously (either demand or supply) and visualizes the equations between the different prices we give it\n- `plot_intercept`: It takes in two different equations (demand and supply), finds the point at which the two intersect, and creates a scatter plot of the result\nWe can leverage these functions and the equations we made earlier to create a graph that shows the market equilibrium.\n\n[Following image is a scatter plot for supply and demand for oranges]\nYou can also practice on your own and download additional data sets [here](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/datasets.html), courtesy of the University of Flordia's Statistics Department. \n## Movements Away from Equilibrium\n\nWhat happens to market equilibrium when either supply or demand shifts due to an exogenous shock?\n\nLet's assume that consumers now prefer Green Tea as their hot beverage of choice moreso than before. We have an outward shift of the demand curve - quantity demanded is greater at every price. The market is no longer in equilibrium.\n\n[Following image is a hand drawn diagram of a shift in demand]\n```{figure} fig1-demand.png\n---\nwidth: 500px\nname: demand-shift\n---\nA shift in the demand curve\n```\n![title](fig1-demand.png)\nAt the same price level (the former equilibrium price), there is a shortage of Green Tea. The amount demanded by consumers exceeds that supplied by producers: $Q_D > Q_S$. This is a seller's market, as the excess quantity demanded gives producers leverage (or market power) over consumers. They are able to increase the price of Green Tea to clear the shortage. As prices increase, consumers who were willing and able to purchase tea at the previous equilibrium price would leave the market, reducing quantity demanded. $Q_S$ and $Q_D$ move up along their respective curves until the new equilibrium is achieved where $Q_S = Q_D$. \n\nThis dual effect of increasing $Q_S$ and $Q_D$ is sometimes referred to as the \"invisible hand\".
